3. Generate customized Solana address in webapp

4. Build solana pay onboarding tutorial with the power of GPT-3 assistant. 
   - Build prompt chaining to answer specific questions

5. Generate comics text with GPT-3, and graphic with Stable Diffusion
   - This is insane

6. Chrome extension that help people doing boring things (productivity or just for fun)
   - Enlighten by GPT-3 writer project, should ship an official chrome extension to production.

7. Solana marketplace that focusing on creator can easily sell their works
   - like solana shopify
   
8. Life gurus / Pocket genies WebApp
   - Focus on building prompt chaining examples.
   - Given multiple inputs and provide specific advice on anything.

# Misc ideas make the process better

1. Create content that keeps a record on N&W process.
   - Blog post may be boring, anime or short clips may work.

2. Keep posting progress on twitter.
   - Build in public is important, every day would be cool, which I've never done before.

# Main ideas to build in 6 weeks

1. Leverage GPT-3 power to generate great prompt chaining.

2. Create solana marketplace for selling works.

# Feedbacks collected from twitter posts (create comic with AI)

1. How to make characters consistent with prompt? (I think this prompt engineering, but what need to be shipped should stay simple)
2. Start with comic cover (this is good)
3. customize generated graphics (maybe frontend effort)
