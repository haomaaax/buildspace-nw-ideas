4. Build solana pay onboarding tutorial with the power of GPT-3 assistant. 
   - Build prompt chaining to answer specific questions

5. Generate comics text with GPT-3, and graphic with Stable Diffusion
   - This is insane

6. Chrome extension that help people doing boring things (productivity or just for fun)
   - Enlighten by GPT-3 writer project, should ship an official chrome extension to production.

7. Solana marketplace that focusing on creator can easily sell their works
   - like solana shopify
   
8. Life gurus / Pocket genies WebApp
   - Focus on building prompt chaining examples.
   - Given multiple inputs and provide specific advice on anything.

# Misc ideas make the process better

1. Create content that keeps a record on N&W process.
   - Blog post may be boring, anime or short clips may work.
   - Haven't do this in S2, only twitter posts.

2. Keep posting progress on twitter.
   - Build in public is important, every day would be cool, which I've never done before.
   - Done this in S2.
   
3. Make prompt chaining result with twitter thread sharing format.
   - make generated storyline can be shared to twitter with one click.
   - Make it 4 comic strip format

4. Make extension is idea collector
   - store ideas with right click save
   - paste them on sparkler website to generate storyline and graphics
   - update: extension have some crashing issue that need to be fixed. Need a user scenario to solve problem.

# Main ideas to build in 6 weeks

1. Leverage GPT-3 power to generate great prompt chaining.
   - Done in S2 ;)

2. Create solana marketplace for selling works.
   - Want to save this one for next season (S3)

# Feedbacks collected from twitter posts (create comic with AI)

1. How to make characters consistent with prompt? 
   - I think this prompt engineering, but what need to be shipped should stay simple.
2. Start with comic cover
   - Haven't don this and this is good idea to focus on one single thing.
3. customize generated graphics
   - seems complicated in current stage, put in backlog.


# Demo day plan

1. Launch on product hunt
2. Let everyone getting some NFT from Sparkler by participating
3. Write a product blog
